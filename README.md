# ElleHacks2022
ElleHacks 2022 Hackathon on February 11, 2022 

## What Did We Create?
For ElleHacks 2022 we decided to create a 2D game called "Saving Valenheim" where a witch must go through levels, collecting incredients to brew a potion to save her village from a curse on her village. In the 24 hour time line, we managed to build out the majority of the settings for multiple levels and get basic player functionality. We had a lot of fun creating this and it helped us work on our developping skills using Unity! 

## Some Things We Learned
Just to name a few things we learned at ElleHacks 2022: working with imported assets, player animations, adding UI elements such as buttons into Untiy, and much much more!

## Implementation
Below is a few screenshots of our game
